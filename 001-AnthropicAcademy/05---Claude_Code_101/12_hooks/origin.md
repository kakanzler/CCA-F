### Hooks
Hooks let you run commands at specific points in Claude Code's lifecycle. The key difference between hooks and everything else covered in this course is that hooks are deterministic — they always run.

## Why Use Hooks
You can tell Claude in your CLAUDE.md to run Prettier after every file edit. Most of the time it will. But sometimes it won't. A hook makes it happen every single time, no exceptions.

Common use cases include:
- Auto-formatting after file edits
- Logging all executed commands for compliance
- Blocking dangerous operations like modifying production files
- Sending yourself notifications when Claude finishes a task

##  How They Work
Hooks are configured in your `settings.json`. You pick an event, optionally set a matcher for which tools it applies to, and provide a command to run. The available events are:

- PreToolUse — runs before a tool call
- PostToolUse — runs after a tool call completes
- UserPromptSubmit — runs when you submit a prompt, before Claude processes it
- Stop — runs when Claude finishes responding
- Notification — runs when Claude sends a notification

You configure them through the `/hooks` command inside Claude Code, or by editing `settings.json` directly.

## A Practical Example
The most common hook: auto-formatting after edits. Set a PostToolUse hook with a matcher of `"Edit|MultiEdit|Write"` so it fires whenever Claude modifies a file. The command checks the file extension and runs the appropriate formatter — Prettier for TypeScript, gofmt for Go, whatever your project uses.

## Blocking with PreToolUse
PreToolUse hooks can block tool calls before they execute. Your hook receives the tool name and input as JSON on stdin. The exit code determines the behavior:

- *Exit code 0* — proceed normally.
- *Exit code 2* — block the action. The stderr message gets fed back to Claude as feedback so it knows why it was blocked and can adjust.
- *Any other exit code* — a non-blocking error that gets shown to you but doesn't stop anything.
This is how you enforce hard rules. Block writes to a production config directory. Block bash commands that contain rm -rf. Block commits to main. Whatever your team needs to be guaranteed, not suggested.

## Sharing Hooks with Your Team
Hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json` are project-level and can be checked into your repo. This means your entire team gets the same hooks automatically. Use the `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable in your commands to reference scripts stored in your project, so they work regardless of Claude's current working directory.

## Recap
Hooks give you deterministic control over Claude Code's behavior. Use PostToolUse for auto-formatting and logging. Use PreToolUse to block dangerous operations. Configure them with `/hooks` or in `settings.json.` And check them into your repo so your team gets them too.

If something needs to happen every time without fail, don't put it in a prompt. Put it in a hook.
